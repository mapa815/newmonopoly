                        <div class="box_text">Similar in gameplay and structure to the great classic board game, New Monopoly®
                                connects players all over the world in a live, multiplayer game experience. Hasbro currently does
                                not have a free virtual board game, nor do they offer a balanced board game experience. Often
                                players at a strategic advantage dominate the game. This online game model will allow players to
                                experience a more difficult, but balanced gameplay with the following added features: <br><br>
                                 Seasons that change the Luck and Charity cards, the board graphics, and the property
                                values.<br><br>
                                 Options that allow randomized board spaces, or other game board styles.<br><br>
                                 House rules that turn a boring old board game into a personalized experience.<br><br>
                                Everyone plays the game a little differently; however, with the help of New Monopoly®, the
                                style of the traditional board game will change forever. Each experience with New Monopoly®
                                will give players a unique sense of familiarity, yet the challenges are far greater. Sign up now,
                                and help us launch New Monopoly® into the future of gaming!</div>
